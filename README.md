# MatGill_CRM
Simulating the Matsuno-Gill response to tropical heating in a cloud-resolving model


# Notes

 - 31st March 2022
   
   - Running with SAM6.11.7 a 2048x512x64 gridpoint case with 3km horizontal resolution and a simple SST forcing like in the Gill problem
     - (Using Marat's changes to pressure solver isn't working...)  
   - What will I see?!?!?!
